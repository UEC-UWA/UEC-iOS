# UEC-iOS

**Author:** Jad Osseiran

**Date:** 23/02/2015

## Getting Up & Running

### What you need

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [Git](http://git-scm.com) - *should come with Xcode's developer tools*
- [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org)
- Knowledge of Objective-C and Cocoa

### Running the code

First you need to clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/UEC-UWA/UEC-iOS.git
    
Once you cloned the repo, navigate to the root directory:

    cd UEC-iOS

**After** you installed Cocoapods run the pod command:

    pod install
    
This will set you up with the dependencies used in the app. 

Made it this far? Good, let's open the workspace:

    open UEC.xcworkspace

And from here you should be able to run the code by pressing `âŒ˜+R`

### Contributing to the code

If you are not too comfortable with Cocoa development but still feel like making some mad changes then make sure to make use of [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)! John or Jad might be able to have a quick look at what you have done and we will try to help you as much as we can.

If you're a ninja and can do it all then go nuts but please try to be constant with the current code style. If you do so everybody wins.
